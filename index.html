I am a master's student working with Dr. Kannan Srinathan at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. I am mainly interested in cryptography. Currently, I am also working with the Homomorphic Encryption Team at Openmined. Prior to this, I spent fall of 2018 visiting Dr. Poh Geong Sen at NUS-SingTel Cyber Security Research & Development Laboratory.
